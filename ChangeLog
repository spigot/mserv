0.12 - Mar 17th 1999
--------------------
- Fixed bugs in new routines
- Fixed output buffer bug

- Wrote new sort routine for sorting tracks according to ratings, since the

0.11 - Mar 16th 1999
--------------------
- Computer users don't cause a recalculation of ratings, should make clients
  that connect and disconnect quickly less likely to cause lag
- Major change in the way tracks are handled - mserv was originally designed
  so that tracks didn't know what album they were in, so that they could
  appear in multiple albums.  This would allow for compilations to be created
  by users etc.  This is now deemed too complicated, albums now know which
  album they are in.
- Added getrate function and removed lots of similar routines.

  of the song, hence INFO returns more helpful info for current track
- Fixed KICK so -ve value isn't allowed
- Added RESET command
- Fixed AUTHOR/NAME command
- Added YEAR command
- Changed MASTER command to LEVEL command and added PRIV level to the existing
  levels of GUEST, USER and MASTER.
