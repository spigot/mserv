Improved Filtering
------------------

A replacement for the mserv filter mechanism. It's backward-compatible
with the old filter, but adds some new features.

Overview:
- The old filter re-parsed the command line for every song it filtered. The
new one pre-parses the command line, building a parse tree and that is
utilized when evaluating each song. Thus, it's faster when processing
huge numbers of songs.
- The new filter uses short-circuit logic to improve performance.
- The new filter has some additional syntax.
- The old filter only had "search=" which did substring searches on title
and author, the new one adds "author=" and "title=" which do exact
matches. For example, "searchf author=bond" will get my Bond
sountrack but not pick up other songs with "bond" somewhere in the
song name. The compare does skip "The " at the start of songs, though,
so "searchf author=beatles" will match both "Beatles" and "The Beatles". It
does support a wildcard '*' at the end of a string (but not the middle).
- The new filter supports arbitrary length, whereas the old one used
arrays and therefore had some limits.
- Whitespace is allowed, allowing expressions to be more legible.

Enhanced ID3v2 support & correct VBR file length
------------------------------------------------

Replacement file for mp3info.c with ID3 V2.2, 2.3, and 2.4 support.
Wraps in prior enhancement for correctly calculating VBR file
lengths.
