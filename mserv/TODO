Things suggested / to do, I might not like them, but they're listed here
so people don't suggest them again:

* Re-write authors code so that the structure is like the genre code
* Command to specify rating of unheard tracks
* It might be nice if history showed the times the tracks were played
* Command to promote a song to the top of the queue
* User's ratings should only be counted once, even if they're logged in twice
* Option to have a beep accompany '** Unrated'
* Section in documentation about when on-disk versions are checked against
  memory copies, e.g. when a track changes, plus the whole lot on certain
  operations, e.g. filter changes, disconnect/reconnect etc
* Fingerprint facility, so that you can take ratings from one server to
  another.
* Last play time for a track should be stored for each user, and the mean
  value used to calculate the temporally adjusted rating.  Maybe
* Should you be able to rate as 'UNHEARD'?
* GAP 1 should say "second" not "seconds"
* Should attempt to cope with pausing in the status time information
* Rating the same song (name/author the same) twice shouldn't mean the song
  is twice as likely to be played
* Ban feature to ban a track for a while
* Do we want abbreviated commands?  dunno.
* Minimum time before replay option enforced on queue requests?
* Filter settings should be reset when a user disconnects?
* Someone needs to write a CDDB grabbing to .trk file program
* Separate filter stuff into a filter.c
* Separate output stuff into an output.c
