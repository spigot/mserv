# This expect script performs some basic testing of mserv.  It
# requires two user accounts to exist; "johan" with password "johan"
# and "root" with password "root".  "johan" should be a normal user
# and "root" a superuser.  It also requires at least one song in one
# album and an otherwise working configuration.
#
# This script must be run when mserv has just started, as it expects
# no history entries and nobody logged in to start with.  A successful
# run ends with mserv being shut down.
#
# A failed run ends either with an error message or that the script
# execution just hangs

# Hang if something unexpected happens
