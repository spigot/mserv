Mserv's web client has been written assuming that the line:

AddHandler cgi-script .cgi

Is in your httpd.conf file of apache.  This makes it possible to run cgi
scripts outside of the cgi-bin directory.

You can either move all the .cgi files into your /cgi-bin/ directory, and
then re-link the html files to point to the right place, or add the line
above.  Both methods are pretty painless.
